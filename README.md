# Assignment: Creating and Using Boolean Variables

**Objective:** The objective of this assignment is to help you practice creating Boolean variables and using them individually in simple conditional statements to control the flow of your program.

## Instructions:

### Part 1: Creating Boolean Variables

Create the following Boolean variables:
- `is_raining`: A variable that represents whether it is raining today. Set this variable to `True` or `False` based on your preference.
- `has_homework`: A variable that represents whether you have homework to complete. Set this variable to `True` or `False`.
- `is_hungry`: A variable that represents whether you are hungry. Set this variable to `True` or `False`.
- `is_weekday`: A variable that represents whether today is a weekday. Set this variable to `True` or `False`.

### Part 2: Using Boolean Variables in Conditional Statements

Use each Boolean variable in a separate conditional statement to determine the outcomes in the following scenarios. Write print statements to output the results, ensuring that a message is always printed regardless of the condition.

- **Scenario 1: Should you bring a raincoat?**
  - Print `"Bring a raincoat."` if it is raining.
  - **Always print:** `"Check the weather before heading out."`

- **Scenario 2: Should you do your homework?**
  - Print `"Time to do your homework."` if you have homework to complete.
  - **Always print:** `"Remember to plan your time wisely."`

- **Scenario 3: Should you eat something?**
  - Print `"You should eat something."` if you are hungry.
  - **Always print:** `"Stay hydrated and healthy."`

- **Scenario 4: Should you get ready for work/school?**
  - Print `"Get ready for work or school."` if today is a weekday.
  - **Always print:** `"Make the most of your day."`

### Part 3: Custom Scenario

Create a custom Boolean variable of your choice (e.g., `is_tired`, `has_pet`, `likes_coffee`). Write a conditional statement that uses this Boolean variable to determine the outcome of a scenario you create. Print the outcome based on the condition you define, and include a message that always prints regardless of the condition.

- **Example Custom Variable:**
  - `is_tired = False`
  - **Custom Scenario:** Print `"Take a break and rest."` if you are tired.
  - **Always print:** `"Remember to balance work and rest."`

**Example Code:**

```python
is_raining = True
has_homework = False
is_hungry = True
is_weekday = True
```
**Output:**
```
# Scenario 1
Bring a raincoat.
Check the weather before heading out.

# Scenario 2
Remember to plan your time wisely.

# Scenario 3
You should eat something.
Stay hydrated and healthy.

# Scenario 4
Get ready for work or school.
Make the most of your day.
```
