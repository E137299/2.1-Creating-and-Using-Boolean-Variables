# 2.1 Creating and Using Boolean Variables

#### **Objective:**
The objective of this assignment is to help you practice creating Boolean variables and using them individually in simple conditional statements to control the flow of your program.

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Part 1: Creating Boolean Variables**
   
   Create the following Boolean variables:
   
   - `is_raining`: A variable that represents whether it is raining today. Set this variable to `True` or `False` based on your preference.
   - `has_homework`: A variable that represents whether you have homework to complete. Set this variable to `True` or `False`.
   - `is_hungry`: A variable that represents whether you are hungry. Set this variable to `True` or `False`.
   - `is_weekday`: A variable that represents whether today is a weekday. Set this variable to `True` or `False`.

2. **Part 2: Using Boolean Variables in Conditional Statements**

   Use each Boolean variable in a separate conditional statement to determine the outcomes in the following scenarios. Write print statements to output the results.

   - **Scenario 1:** Should you bring a raincoat?
     - Print `"Bring a raincoat."` if it is raining.
     - Otherwise, print `"No need for a raincoat today."`

   - **Scenario 2:** Should you do your homework?
     - Print `"Time to do your homework."` if you have homework to complete.
     - Otherwise, print `"Enjoy your free time!"`

   - **Scenario 3:** Should you eat something?
     - Print `"You should eat something."` if you are hungry.
     - Otherwise, print `"You're not hungry right now."`

   - **Scenario 4:** Should you get ready for work/school?
     - Print `"Get ready for work or school."` if today is a weekday.
     - Otherwise, print `"It's the weekend, relax!"`

   **Example:**
   ```python
   is_raining = True
   has_homework = False
   is_hungry = True
   is_weekday = True
    ```
    ```python
   # Scenario 1 Output
   Bring a raincoat.


   # Scenario 2
   Enjoy your free time!


   # Scenario 3
   You should eat something.


   # Scenario 4
   Get ready for work or school.

   ```

3. **Part 3: Custom Scenario**

   Create a custom Boolean variable of your choice (e.g., `is_tired`, `has_pet`, `likes_coffee`). Write a conditional statement that uses this Boolean variable to determine the outcome of a scenario you create. Print the outcome based on the condition you define.
